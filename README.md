This repository contains the code and report for Introduction to ML COMP60012 Decision Tree Coursework at imperial College London for 2023. For description of the task check the description  [PDF](co553_DTcoursework_V21_22_60012.pdf)

It is the combinational work of Runshen Lu (02033159), Mo Lin (02027654), and Han Jiao (02030048).

The main code is in the [python file](decision_tree_cross_validation.py) decision_tree_cross_validation.py. Running this code will print the mean accuracy and confusion matrix of the training data. The decision tree digure will be output through [decision_tree.png](decision_tree.png)

the dataset used for this project is in [wifi_db](/wifi_db) folder. It can be changed through the data_path variable in the python code. 

To run the code, make sure dependencies in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) are properly installed.
